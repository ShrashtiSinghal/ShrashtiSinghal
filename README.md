# Hi, I’m Shrashti 👋

AI Product Manager at **Culinda Inc.** who builds as much as she plans.

I work at the intersection of **product vision, full-stack AI engineering, and agent systems**.  
I don’t just talk about AI products. I design them, ship them, and iterate in public.

## What I build 🚀

### 🤖 AI & Agent Systems
- AI agents (single + multi-agent)
- Tool-calling, memory, and workflow orchestration
- Agent-backed products, not just notebooks
- FastAPI-powered backends for AI services

### 🧠 Full-Stack AI
- Java-first mindset with modern AI stacks
- APIs, services, and integrations that scale
- End-to-end AI features: backend → product → UX
- Practical ML, not academic-only experiments

### 🧩 Applied Machine Learning
- Data curation & pipelines
- Model experimentation and evaluation
- Turning ML outputs into usable product features

## Product Management, but hands-on 🧭

I practice **builder-style product management**:

- Product vision & strategy for AI-native products  
- Translating fuzzy AI capabilities into clear user value  
- PRDs that engineers actually want to read  
- Rapid prototyping to validate product bets  
- Shipping > slides  

I believe great AI PMs:
- understand the **tech deeply**
- can reason about **trade-offs**
- and are comfortable getting their hands dirty in code

## Tech I work with 🛠️

- **Languages:** Java, JavaScript, Python  
- **Backend:** FastAPI, REST APIs  
- **AI/ML:** LLMs, agent frameworks, applied ML  
- **Systems:** Distributed systems, cloud-native apps  
- **Frontend:** Full-stack integrations for AI features

## What you’ll find here 📦

- Cloud computing & distributed systems projects  
- Applied ML and data work  
- Full-stack AI experiments  
- Product-driven repositories (not toy demos)

Most repos here exist because:
> “I wanted to understand how this actually works in a real product.”

## Let’s talk 💬

I enjoy conversations about:
- AI product management tools & workflows  
- Building AI products that users trust  
- Agents in production vs theory  
- Where PMs should (and shouldn’t) use AI  

If you’re building something interesting in AI, product, or systems — happy to connect.
